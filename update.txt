[06/03/2025], we are focusing on haviung a well structured idea of how the project is going to be executed as a team. We are now searching functions explainations asking each other every question related to any doubt.
[07/03/2025] We took a more aggressive approach, going straight to dividing the work into the macros 'parser' (tokenization and creation of the Binary Tree) and 'executor' (built-ins management and execution of the Binary Tree).
{ A binary tree in Minishell is used to represent the syntactic structure of commands allowing hierarchical management of operators | && || ; which facilitates recursive execution and operator precedence handling }
Antonio (apintaur): Parsing;
Ahmed (ahabdelr): Executor;
[08/03/2025] We have established the initial framework of the project and are beginning the foundational work, with tasks divided as previously outlined.
[10/03/2025] After a weekend taken to organize the code-related part of the project, we focused on setting up built-ins and the fundamentals of the recursivity behind the project.
[12/03/2025] We arrived to the most boring part, the one where you just find stuff that you couldn't foresee before starting the project ðŸ¥².
