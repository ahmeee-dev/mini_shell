# Minishell
> A lightweight yet powerful Unix shell designed for simplicity and efficiency.

## Introduction
Welcome to Minishell – the minimal shell that gets straight to the point. We know most people will only read this introduction, so here’s everything you need to know: Minishell is built to execute commands, handle basic built-in functions, and support piping and redirection. Whether you’re here to test a new idea or use a reliable tool, Minishell keeps things simple without sacrificing functionality.

## Features
- **Command Execution:** Execute external commands using your system’s PATH.
- **Built-In Commands:** Includes essential functions like `cd`, `echo`, `exit`, and `env`.
- **Piping & Redirection:** Supports pipes (`|`), input (`<`), and output (`>`) redirection.
- **Signal Handling:** Gracefully handles interrupts (e.g., `Ctrl+C`) and end-of-file (e.g., `Ctrl+D`).
- **Environment Variable Management:** Easily manipulate and expand environment variables.

## Installation
Follow these simple steps to install and run Minishell:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minishell.git
    cd minishell
    ```

2. **Compile the Source:**
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    *Note:* Ensure you have `gcc` (or any compatible C compiler) and `make` installed.

3. **Run Minishell:**
    ```bash
    ./minishell
    ```

## Usage
Once Minishell is up and running, you can start interacting with it much like any other Unix shell:

- **Execute Commands:** Simply type any command and hit Enter.
- **Built-In Functions:** Use built-ins like `cd` to navigate directories or `exit` to close the shell.
- **Redirection & Piping:** Utilize `>` and `<` for file redirection, and `|` to connect commands.
- **Help:** For a quick reminder of available built-ins, type `help` within the shell.

## Built With
- **C Language:** Core implementation leveraging standard Unix system calls.
- **GNU Make:** Automates the build process.
- **Unix/Linux Environment:** Designed specifically for Unix-like operating systems.
